# Space Ship Titanic

With this notebook I participated in the Kaggle competition [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/overview).
The Kaggle competition focuses on predicting which passengers of the Spaceship Titanic, launched in 2912, were transported to an alternate dimension after a collision with a spacetime anomaly. 
Participants use recovered records from the ship's damaged computer system to identify the affected individuals and aid in their rescue, mirroring the historical tragedy of the original Titanic but with a futuristic, cosmic twist.

The competition's aim is to deepen [my absolved Kaggle lessons](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7045347017476165633/) on machine learning and deep learning. It covers crucial aspects of feature engeneering and data representation, 
e.g. One-Hot encoders, and designing models and searching for optimal hyper parameters. 

Through these experiences I qualified for teh advanced machine learning school [ML4Good](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7116057666992357376/), apply [here](https://www.ml4good.org/courses/uk-march-2024) 
for the cohort 2024 and find further updates, and to developp concrete steps for my [own reasearch project](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10015). 

I have profited a lot from simple example codes, like this one, therefore I share my own code as well! 

Happy coding :-)
